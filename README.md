# Data Professional Salary Prediction

This project explores predicting salaries of data professionals using advanced machine learning techniques. It aims to understand the most influential factors affecting salaries in this field using regression models

## Overview

In this project, we explored a dataset containing various attributes of data professionals such as experience, education, job title, and location. Using Python and popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and pandas, we developed multiple regression models to accurately predict salaries.


## Features

- Data exploration and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Feature engineering to prepare data for modeling.
- Development and evaluation of several regression models: linear regression, decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting.
- Model optimization through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
- Identification of key factors influencing salaries of data professionals.


## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model development
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development
- Git for version control

## Results 
The best prediction results were achieved with the Random Forest model, reaching a coefficient of determination (RÂ²) of 0.9406. This demonstrates a strong ability to predict data professional salaries based on the analyzed variables.
